# Python-Scheduler
This program creates a scheduling system where the user can schedule a day and a time to meet from the dictionary of days and times that are available.
Upon booking a time, the user can then input their name to confirm their reservation.
Should the user choose to quit the program without inputting their name as confirmation, the program will not save the day and time that the user tried to reserve.
After a day and time has been booked, that time on that specific day will no longer be visible for future users to book as it has been taken.
The program also allows a user to view all of the bookings that have been made throughout each session.
